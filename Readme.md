## Requirements

Before deploying or interacting with the contract, ensure the following are installed:

1. **Internet Connection**: Ensure stable access.
2. **Yarn**: Latest version is required. You can install it by following [these instructions](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).
3. **Scaffold-ETH 2**: A modern starter kit for decentralized applications. Clone from the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2
    ```
4. **Metis Faucet**: You'll need test Metis tokens for deployment on the testnet. Use the Metis Faucet here:
